# basic-blackjack-game
## Description-
This program simulates a simplified version of Blackjack. The player and the dealer are each dealt two cards initially. The player can choose to draw additional cards ('hit') until they either reach a score of 21 ('blackjack') or choose to stop ('stand'). After the player's turn, the dealer draws cards until their score is 17 or higher. The winner is determined based on the final scores, with the goal being to get as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it ('busting').
